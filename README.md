# DeWixer
DeWixer is a Python program that removes Wix ads, and converts a Wix link to Neocities.
# Neocites API
The Neocities API allows you to automatically upload your converted Wix site to your Neocities one. To set up the API, you need a API key, once you have retrieved that, type after your site name: -aset. Example: 
```
https://example.wixsite.com/example -aset
```
You'll see a prompt asking for your API key, paste it in and you're done.
